For library alpha 1:

* Figure out the shared library problem wrt updating.  Do we need a way to
  mark such relationships that aren't LIB_DEPENDS?  I'm leaning towards a 
  hashing based solution.
* mport_sort_pkg_list(), so you can say mport delete xfce* and have it do 
  in the right order
* fix the progress bar for update.  
* mport_update()

For tool alpha 1:

* tree handling
* update
* install
* expand query:
	query -a[ll] foo    
	query -up[depends] foo
	query -as[sets] foo
	query foo # normal display
* owner file (what package owns this file)
* cleanup SIGINT
* browse
* list
